# Five-simple-tools-for-stochastic-lattice-creation

This is repository shares stochastic lattice files. These are part of the publication "Five simple tools for stochastic lattice creation" [1].

The included STL files are:

1. The regular face centred cubic (FCC) lattice as shown in Figure 5 [1].
2. The isotropic FCC structure with a randomisation value of Sigma = 0.15 as shown in Figure 5 [1].
3. The isotropic FCC structure with a randomisation value of Sigma = 0.30 as shown in Figure 5 [1].

The STL files were repaired for additive manufacturing and disconnected shells were removed.

The naming convention of the files is as follows:

Type **-** Unit Cell Size **-** No. of Unit Cells in X-Y-Z direction **-** Relative Density **-** Randomisation X-Y-Z **-** Randomisation Rx-Ry-Rz
